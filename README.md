# OS Hub Tools

The goal of this project is to produce a set of VM images for virtualbox such
that you can start from a working image without going through the trouble of
setup. 

Ideally, it also has the vbox guest additions installed as well so that it
just works.

Likely it would need another step afterwards to create users and such with
ansible, but this should get everything to state where that is possible.
